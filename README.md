A machine learning-based skin disease detection system using EfficientNetB0 and TensorFlow. This project includes the model training code and a Streamlit web application for user interaction.

## Features

- **EfficientNetB0 Model**: Trained on a dataset of skin disease images for classification.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Provides an intuitive interface to upload images and get predictions on skin diseases.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Streamlit for easy access and testing.

## Usage

The application is hosted on Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://skin-diesease-detector.streamlit.app/).

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/insominiac21/ML.git
   cd ML
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Access the app at `http://localhost:8501`.
